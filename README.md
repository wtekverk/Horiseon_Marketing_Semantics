# Horiseon_Marketing_Semantics

## Description

In this project my goal was to create a more accessible platform. While to begin with this website worked aside from a couple minor bugs it did not meet modern accessibility standards. My goal was to modify that while also cleaning up the code and some redundancies.

To make this site more accessible I added alt text where needed and fixed some errors in the navigation bar. In addition, I added semantics to the html document. No only did this clear up many of the classes used it also made the code easier to read. During this project I also cleared out many of the CSS redundancies. Many of the classes were the same so I merged them and cleared out the excess code that was no longer necessary. In addition, I re ordered the code to mirror the html document a little better making it easier to navigate for specific content.
